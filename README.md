# Smorrery: a simple orrery app

![](https://imgur.com/ECB6ciw.png)

## Description

1. The **index page** offers a streamlined interface for viewing [Near-Earth Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object) (NEO) data retrieved from NASA's SBDB API.
2. The **orrery web app** simulates the orbital motion of the eight planets in our solar system from 1900 to 2100. Users can adjust the simulation speed via a control panel and toggle visual elements such as orbits, labels, and axes for enhanced viewing. 

## Usage

1. Create a Python virtual environment and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `flask run` in shell to launch the Flask development server locally.
3. Open a browser and access the index page at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
4. Access the orrery web app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/orrery`.

## New features (2024-10-04)

- **Celestial Lab ‚Äî Create an asteroid!**. 
    1. Input the mass, initial position and velocity, and give it a name.
    2. Launch your asteroid!
    3. Draw auxiliary visual objects, such as specific , eccentricity vectors
- *Caution! Coordinate transformation problems. (To be fixed)*
- Fixed Saturn's ring texture problem.

## New features (2024-09-30)

- Render the traces of 20 NEOs.
- Add textures for the Sun and planets.
- Include a starry sky background with Milky Way.
- Add rings of Saturn (~~texture mapping has an issue, temporarily replaced with a white color~~)
- Hovering over celestial objects with the mouse triggers a green glow
- Clicking on the mesh or label of a celestial object displays its information, currently printed in the console

## Future work

- Add a dropdown menu containing checkboxes to toggle the display of different types of celestial objects (such as the Sun, planets, [NEOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object), [PHAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentially_hazardous_object), other asteroids, etc.)
- Compare calculated planetary positions with [ephemerides](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/eph_export.html) for accuracy.
- Add an "impact risk" view that visualizes and emphasizes the proximity of Earth's orbit and some NEOs' orbits.
- Add more educational canvases that can be used to teach concepts such as Kepler's laws or the Sun-Earth‚ÄìMoon system.
- Add planetary axial tilt and rotation, with special emphasis on Earth.
- Add the Moon üåô and more moons.
